# Enhanced Factor-Based Curation Implementation

## Overview

The BugSigDB system has been enhanced with a comprehensive factor-based approach to determine paper curation readiness. This implementation provides a more nuanced and detailed assessment of papers, ensuring higher quality curation while maintaining inclusivity for both human/animal and environmental studies.

## Factor-Based Assessment Structure

### General Factors (Applicable to ALL Study Types)
These 6 fundamental factors are required for any paper to be considered ready for curation:

1. **Specific Microbial Taxa Identification**
   - Explicit mentions of microbial names (e.g., Nocardiaceae, Bacteroides, phyla, genera, species)
   - Prioritizes the most granular level provided

2. **Differential Abundance/Compositional Changes**
   - Statements indicating significant increases, decreases, enrichment, depletion
   - Differences in overall community structure between groups/conditions

3. **Proper Experimental Design**
   - Clear description of study setup, experimental groups, control groups, and replication

4. **Microbiota Characterization Methodology**
   - Details on how the microbial community was analyzed (e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics)

5. **Quantitative Data/Statistical Significance**
   - P-values, fold-changes, relative abundances, diversity metrics, effect sizes, or other numerical data

6. **Data Availability/Repository Information**
   - Mention of raw data deposited in public repositories (e.g., SRA, ENA) with accession numbers

### Human/Animal Study Factors (5 Additional Criteria)
Additional criteria for host-associated studies:

7. **Host Health Outcome/Phenotype Associations**
   - Clear links between microbial changes and specific health conditions, diseases, physiological states
   - Examples: Hypertension, increased body weight, altered metabolic markers, inflammatory responses

8. **Host/Study Population Characteristics**
   - Detailed descriptors of host organisms or human participants
   - Examples: "Adult female offspring," "pregnant dams," "women with PCOS"

9. **Intervention/Exposure Details** (if applicable)
   - Specifics of experimental manipulation, treatment, or exposure
   - Examples: Dose, duration, route of administration

10. **Sample Type from Host**
    - Where the microbial sample was collected from the host
    - Examples: Fecal microbiota, gut microbiota, skin, oral, vaginal

11. **Proposed Molecular Mechanisms/Pathways**
    - Specific host or microbial molecules, genes, or metabolic pathways implicated
    - Examples: Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), adipokines, specific enzymes

### Environmental Study Factors (5 Additional Criteria)
Additional criteria for environmental studies:

12. **Environmental Context/Associated Factors**
    - Specific environmental factors or properties linked to microbial communities
    - Examples: Location/spatial data, physical/chemical parameters, source/material, anthropogenic influence

13. **Sample Type from Environment**
    - Specific matrix or material from which sample was collected
    - Examples: Dust, surface swab, soil core, water column, air filter

14. **Geospatial Data** (Highly Valued)
    - Exact locations, GPS coordinates, altitude, latitude/longitude if provided

15. **Study Duration/Seasonality**
    - If study spanned specific time period, multiple seasons, or before/after environmental event

16. **Associated Chemical/Physical Measurements**
    - Environmental parameters measured alongside microbial samples
    - Examples: Soil texture, water chemistry, air quality indices

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced LLM Prompt (`models/gemini_qa.py`)

**Comprehensive Criteria Structure:**
- Clear hierarchy: General factors → Study-specific factors
- Detailed "What to look for" guidance for each factor
- Specific examples for each criterion
- Factor-based analysis section in output

**Updated Output Format:**
```
**FACTOR-BASED ANALYSIS:**
- General Factors Present: [List which of the 6 general factors are present]
- Human/Animal Factors Present: [List which of the 5 human/animal factors are present, if applicable]
- Environmental Factors Present: [List which of the 5 environmental factors are present, if applicable]
- Missing Critical Factors: [List any missing factors that prevent curation readiness]
```

### 2. Enhanced Parsing Function

**New Fields Added:**
```python
curation_analysis = {
    # Existing fields...
    "general_factors_present": [],
    "human_animal_factors_present": [],
    "environmental_factors_present": [],
    "missing_critical_factors": [],
    "factor_based_score": 0.0
}
```

**Factor-Based Score Calculation:**
```python
total_factors = len(general_factors) + len(human_animal_factors) + len(environmental_factors)
max_factors = 16  # 6 general + 5 human/animal + 5 environmental
factor_based_score = min(1.0, total_factors / max_factors)
```

### 3. Enhanced UI Components (`web/static/index.html`)

**New Analysis Section:**
- Factor-Based Analysis display
- Color-coded badges for different factor types
- Factor-based score with percentage
- Missing factors highlighting

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Green badges**: General factors present
- **Blue badges**: Human/animal factors present
- **Yellow badges**: Environmental factors present
- **Red badges**: Missing critical factors

### 4. Enhanced JavaScript (`web/static/js/curation-analysis.js`)

- Updated `clearCurationAnalysis()`: Includes new fields
- Enhanced `displayMicrobialSignatureAnalysis()`: Calls factor analysis
