### 3. `web/static/js/curation-analysis.js`

**New Functions Added:**
- `displayFactorBasedAnalysis()`: Handles factor display with proper styling
- Enhanced `displayMicrobialSignatureAnalysis()`: Calls factor analysis
- Updated `clearCurationAnalysis()`: Includes new factor fields

**Factor Display Logic:**
```javascript
function displayFactorBasedAnalysis(analysis) {
    // Display general factors with green badges
    const generalFactorsElement = document.getElementById('general-factors-list');
    if (generalFactorsElement) {
        const factors = analysis.general_factors_present || [];
        if (factors.length > 0) {
            generalFactorsElement.innerHTML = factors.map(factor => 
                `<span class="badge bg-success me-1 mb-1">${factor}</span>`
            ).join('');
        } else {
            generalFactorsElement.innerHTML = '<span class="text-muted">No general factors identified</span>';
        }
    }
    
    // Similar logic for human/animal factors (blue badges)
    // Similar logic for environmental factors (yellow badges)
    // Similar logic for missing factors (red badges)
    
    // Display factor-based score
    const scoreElement = document.getElementById('factor-based-score');
    if (scoreElement) {
        const score = analysis.factor_based_score || 0.0;
        const percentage = Math.round(score * 100);
        scoreElement.innerHTML = `<span class="badge bg-primary">${percentage}% (${score.toFixed(2)})</span>`;
    }
}
```

## Visual Design System

### Color-Coded Factor Categories:
- **Green Badges**: General factors (6 fundamental factors)
- **Blue Badges**: Human/animal factors (5 host-specific factors)
- **Yellow Badges**: Environmental factors (5 environmental factors)
- **Red Badges**: Missing critical factors
- **Primary Badges**: Factor-based score and signature types

### Layout Structure:
1. **Basic Assessment Column**: Readiness status, microbial signatures, data quality, statistical significance, data completeness
2. **Factor-Based Analysis Column**: Factor-based score, factor breakdown by category, missing factors
3. **Detailed Sections**: Explanation, signature types, specific reasons, missing fields, examples

## Integration Points
